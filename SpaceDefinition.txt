The definition of a matching tile game consists of:

A. A grid width (2 to 17) and height (2 to 17)
B. A specification of up to six different tile types (T1 to T6)
C. A series of response-to-player actions (RA)
D. A series of spawning actions (SA)
E. A series of moving actions (MovA)
F. A series of matching actions (MatchA)
G. A losing condition (L)
H. A winning condition (W)

The specification of a tile type consists of:

A. A colour id (green, red, yellow, purple, pink, blue)
B. A shape (circle, triangle, hexagon, square)
C. A size (1 to 10), which is relative to the cell size

A response-to-player action consists of:

A. Conjunction/Disjunction specifier
B. A series of individual match conditions
C. A boolean indicating that the action only happens if it fires a matching action
D. A series of board-change actions

An individual matching condition consists of:

A. A boolean indication whether the match needs to hold or not
B. A specification of the set (S) cell types in the condition
(how many: dragged empty cells, dragged tiles, empty neighbours, tiled neighbours)
C. What aspect of the cells are being matched (null, colour, shape, size)
D. The minimal number of cells in S that must match
E. A boolean specifying whether the matching group need to be in an ortholine or not (no corners)

A board-change action consists of:

A. An individual matching condition specifying the cells the action occurs on
B. A single alteration action, from: clear all; populate empty cells; repulse neighbours; switch (for pairs only);

An individual spawning action consists of:

A. A specification of a collection of tile types into a shape (up to 3x3 tiles)
B. A location (top, bottom, left, right, in-grid) at which the shape will appear
